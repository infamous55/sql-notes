# Introduction to SQL

### What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a programming language used to manage relational databases. Created in the 1970s, it has become the standard language for interacting with relational databases, also known as SQL databases. SQL is widely used by database administrators, developers, and data analysts, making it a valuable skill to have.

### Relational databases
Relational databases store information in tables. A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns, where a column represents a particular category and a row specifies a single entry. Common data types which can be stored in a SQL database include INT (integer) and REAL (real number), DATE and TIME, CHAR (character) and TEXT.

### Statements
A statement is a valid SQL command. Any statement ends with a semicolon. The structure of a statement may vary, and line breaks don't influence the outcome of the command. The language is not case sensitive, but keywords are written uppercase by convention.
